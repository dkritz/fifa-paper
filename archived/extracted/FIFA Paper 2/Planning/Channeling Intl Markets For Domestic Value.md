# CHANNELING INTERNATIONAL MARKETS FOR DOMESTIC VALUE #

## Michael's Proposal ##
And, then, let's talk about our next steps. I know we have some ideas and notes about further papers, if we're going to do this, now is the time for me. Also, depending on your interest and availability, I am going to start 2-3 papers while here at OPIC, and could definitely use some co-author support. I'm meeting with a USAID RA tomorrow afternoon, too, to help with the lit and data collection, and will have a better description of my research goals after that meeting.

## What do I think ##
1. clubs beget nations
2. mobile players move to the club that match their ability
3. metro areas support better clubs with bigger budgets
4. the best players flow from low to high value contracts

This finding also implies that a country rich in talent but afflicted by corrupt club organizations is going to underperform relative to its talent and passion for the game at the international level. Foer's (2004) characterization of Brazilian clubs matches that description, making local corruption the culprit preventing the Canarinho from reaching their potential in the last three World Cups.


## Abstract ##
This paper investigates potential links between the international and club-level soccer using a measure of quality defined by the performance of its club teams in international competitions. We address inherent endogeneity by employing an instrumental variables approach, based on the urban population share of a country. Our identifying strategy assumes that the support for soccer clubs in metropolitan areas that drives club-level success affects national teams only through their impact on domestic professional players; being born a great athlete to a particular nationality still remains to chance. Using annual panel data from 1993 to 2010 for all FIFA countries, we isolate the impact of domestic club strength on national teams and demonstrate a positive impact on national team results. The converse should also hold, and our results thus suggest that the long decline of Brazilian club soccer played a salient role in the results for the 2014 World Cup host.

## Conclusion ##
This paper finds that international networks can have a significant impact on domestic value, using the specific analysis of the relationship between domestic soccer leagues and their national teams. Using a two-stage regression that incorporates the urban population of a country to isolate the impact of club success on national team success, we provide statistical evidence that a stronger domestic league positively affects national team performance. In a specific example, the results suggest that the U.S. Soccer team benefited from the presence of both one of its better national team players, Landon Donovan, and one of the better English players, David Beckham, on the U.S. domestic club LA Galaxy. The stronger the domestic club league, MLS, the better should be the U.S. national team.

Other major results of this paper provide further support for certain empirical rigidities in the relevant literature. With a few notable exceptions, like the United States and China, the larger, richer countries generally perform best at soccer. Countries with better living conditions, as proxied by life expectancy at birth, also generally perform better on the pitch. Access to international networks, as measured by the trade “openness”, has a positive impact in Europe. This is less the case for FIFA overall, mainly due to the exceptional performance of teams from South America. Higher dependence on oil rents is associated with lower soccer outcomes in Europe and North America, and conversely, with higher soccer success in South America.

The results highlight the internal logic that the best players in the world (e.g., Lionel Messi) play for the best clubs (e.g., FC Barcelona), which feed the best national teams (e.g., Spain), leading to their conspicuous international success over the past decade. These same findings also support Foer’s (2004) description of Brazilian clubs as corrupt and downtrodden, leading the Canarinho to disappointing performance as hosts of the 2014 World Cup.

## Michael's Comments ##
I am attaching a revised version of the paper along with a Call for Paper & Author Guidelines for an open-source peer-reviewed journal, "Global Journal of Interdisciplinary Social Sciences" that arrived at my USAID account yesterday. I suggest that we consider submitting this paper to the journal (**deadline** for their next issue is **Aug 20**) for a few reasons:

1. the paper is published after two years of drafting and conferencing
2. none of us are going for tenure with this paper so it just goes on the resume
3. shows up in lit searches
4. I don't mind the 'interdisciplinary social sciences' line because for me it softens things, as I'm often on the defensive for channeling research efforts into this soft work (as if the world is holding its breath on my 'hard' research), it's the moniker 'Global' in the title that signals low-end open-source journal to anyone who submits to the peer-review process

The benefit of holding out would be a more prestigious journal, but if so let's get something turned around soon. I want to move on this because I have a window for research in the next few months and want to get things completed.

The changes to the paper didn't show up well in a compare-documents because I also made it all TNR font-9 and A4 sized, to accommodate the journal specs, but they are pretty straightforward: the abstract was whittled down to eliminate references to Spain; the Introduction added Germany to our list of dominant national teams; I moved the first paragraph on "we add to the literature" from Section 2 to the Introduction (felt like it flowed better); moved the F/N on post-estimation identification statistics to the main body (formerly Fn 21 on pg 19); updated the conclusion to put the 2014 World Cup in the past tense. There's an internal note on Fn 4 referring to the UEFA games that needs to be updated.

If we do this, we will need to find some kind of framework to make it more than just "sports economics", which we've talked about before. If you all are keen for this, let's do some brainstorming. I came up with: Globalization (boring, very 20th century), core/periphery (too socialist), trade in human capital (too highbrow for what we're actually doing) and **International Networks**, which is what I put in as the working title. One thing we definitely need to do is get past "The Triumph of Passion" given that most commentators argued that the Germany-Brazil match was an implosion & disaster of passion.

If you guys are game, and we have an idea for how to frame the paper, that's just a couple paragraphs at the beginning and the end. We also need to fix the years on the reference sheet for consistency with the journal requirements, that's about 10 minutes or so of busy work.

And, then, let's talk about our next steps. I know we have some ideas and notes about further papers, if we're going to do this, now is the time for me. Also, depending on your interest and availability, I am going to start 2-3 papers while here at OPIC, and could definitely use some co-author support. I'm meeting with a USAID RA tomorrow afternoon, too, to help with the lit and data collection, and will have a better description of my research goals after that meeting.

## Szymanski had this to say ##
Hi Narek

i've been meaning to write to you for a while, after meeting you at the Westerns last year, but ...well, usual boring excuses. Anyway, I see we're in the same session and it sounds as if your paper follows on from last year's. Did you make any progress with that paper? My advice, for what it's worth, is to try to focus the paper around an issue which is not specifically sporting.

why should we care if club performance influences national performance? If you're not interested in sports (and a lot of economists aren't) then you need an extra motivation. Even editors interested in sports feel they need a good reason unconnected to their interest in sport (more so than if you wrote a paper about, say, garbage collection).

I imagine the selling point would be something to do with spillovers and networks. Isn't the Premier League (/La Liga/bundesliga), the silicon valley of soccer? silicon valley requires an open market for talent- but on the other hand lax immigration rules are politically unpopular, **[so there's a conflict](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/12/business/12immig.html?pagewanted=all)**.

In sport we see the same issue about whether the national team (the sporting equivalent of national income) benefits from labour mobility- your paper says it does. Maybe you've already done this with your current paper, but if not, that is what I would recommend.

Anyway, I thought you might be interested in my paper too- I'm looking at similar data and you can easily see the wider economic issue I have tried to tie it to. Any comments from you or your co-authors welcome.

Best
