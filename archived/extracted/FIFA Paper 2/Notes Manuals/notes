Is there any model of social welfare that includes the success of national sports teams?

Why should we even care?  All we are doing is based on the assumption that we do care, or that success in a global competitive sport like soccer is indicative of national health, or shows us alternative paths towards success in various endeavors at a national scale.  What is the bigger picture?

Pull in Michael's edited notes with other stuff into a single giant paper.

Where to put discussion vs. where to put stuff we might actually include in the paper?
