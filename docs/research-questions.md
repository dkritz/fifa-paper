# Research Questions

This document tracks the high-level research questions that guide replication
and any post-publication extensions.

## Original paper questions
From the introduction and abstract of the paper:
- Do strong domestic leagues, or at least strong domestic clubs, improve
  national team success?
- What is the causal relationship between domestic club success (CLUB) and
  national team success (FIFA points) once endogeneity is addressed?
- Does domestic club strength have a positive impact on national team results
  when controlling for wealth, population, and macro/resource factors?

## Post-publication questions (predictive accuracy)
These questions focus on whether the paper's approach would have helped predict
recent and upcoming World Cup outcomes:
- How accurately would the model have predicted World Cup performance in 2018
  and 2022 using only data available before those tournaments?
- Would the model have ever predicted Argentina as World Cup champion in 2022?
- Does Messi's presence in the US soccer ecosystem change the United States'
  projected chances for 2026 under this framework?
- Would the model predict England as the 2026 World Cup winner?
- Would the model ever predict a South American World Cup victory under the
  post-2010 data trend?
